# Hello zip code 

Hello zip code is a single page web app that loads a json file (public/nv.json) and finds the 
zip code that the user types in and append together any of hello strings associated 
with that zip code and displays them on the screen. 

The app is very simple and should be maintainable by anyone who knows javascript and 
has taken a React tutorial. 

## Testing 

I added a fake zip code, 99999, that has 3 entires to show that the appending works for a
zip code with three entires. 

## Questions 

* Where would you like to host this? It requires no server beside the web server itself.
* I could set myself up to host webservers for you on my AWS account. 
* When I build things like this, is there a gitlab or github account or something were 
  you want the code to live?

## React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
